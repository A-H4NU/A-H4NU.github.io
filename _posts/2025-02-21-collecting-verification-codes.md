## Introduction

When I try to log into my university's SSO system, it gives me a two-digit
verification code that I must select on my cellphone. For instance, in the images
below, the website (on the left) shows the number 25, and I would tap 25 on my
phone (on the right). Now, I'm curious about how many attempts I would need to
make to see all possible 100 codes.

## Problem Statement

Let $$S$$ be a finite set of size $$N$$. At the beginning, a set $$F$$ is
initialized to be an empty set. For each step, a random element $$r$$ is chosen
at uniformly random from $$S$$ and put to $$F$$, i.e., $$F \leftarrow F \cup \{
  r \}$$. Then, what is the expected number of steps to reach $$S = F$$?

Now, take your time to solve this problem! (Hint: it is easy.)

## Solution

### Solution 1

For fixed $$N$$, suppose there are $$n$$ elements should be chosen to reach $$S
= F$$. In other words, $$n = |S \setminus F|$$. Now, let $$a_n$$ be the
expected number of additional steps at the moment. We let $$a_0 = 0$$.

Then, we have $$n/N$$ probability of getting a new fresh number and
$$1-n/N$$ probability of getting a number that has been chosen before. Thus,
noticing that we need this one step to choose an element,
we
have the following recursive formula:

\begin{equation}
  a_n = 1 + \frac{n}{N} \cdot a_{n-1} + \left(1 - \frac{n}{N}\right) \cdot a_n
\end{equation}

Rearranging, we get

\begin{equation}\label{eq:2}
  a_n = a_{n-1} + \frac{N}{n}\text{.}
\end{equation}

Equation \eqref{eq:2} directly gives

\begin{equation}
  a_n = N \cdot \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{i} = N \cdot H_n
\end{equation}

where $$H_n$$ is the $$n$$-th harmonic number.

In particular, we have $$a_N = N \cdot H_N$$.

### Solution 2

For fixed $$N$$, let $$X_i$$ be a random variable for the number of
steps until the next element which has not been chosen before when there are
$$i$$ elements not chosen. Then, we immediately get $$\mathbb{E}[X_i] = N/i$$.
Then, $$X$$, the random variable for the number of steps to reach $$F = S$$
equals $$\sum_{i=1}^N X_i$$; by linearity, we get

$$\mathbb{E}[X] = \sum_{i=1}^N \mathbb{E}[X_i] = N \cdot \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{1}{i} = N \cdot H_N\text{.}$$

## Conclusion

Hence, as $$100 \cdot H_100 \approx 518.74$$, I shall expect about 519 log-in tries to observe all
100 numbers.
